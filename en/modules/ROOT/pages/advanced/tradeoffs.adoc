[[architecture]]
Architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is not your typical Ruby on Rails Vanilla App. We've tried using
http://decide.es[Consul] but we found some problems on reutilization,
adaptation, modularization and configuration. You can read more about
that on
"https://www.gitbook.com/book/alabs/propuesta-de-cambios-en-la-arquitectura-de-consul/details[Propuesta
de Cambios de Arquitectura de Consul]".

[[turbolinks]]
Turbolinks
~~~~~~~~~~

Decidim doesn't support `turbolinks` so it isn't included on our
generated apps and it's removed for existing Rails applications which
install the Decidim engine.

The main reason is we are injecting some scripts into the body for some
individual pages and Turbolinks loads the scripts in parallel. For some
libraries like http://leafletjs.com/[leaflet] it's very inconvenient
because its plugins extend an existing global object.

The support of Turbolinks was dropped in
https://github.com/decidim/decidim/commit/d8c7d9f63e4d75307e8f7a0360bef977fab209b6[d8c7d9f].
If you're interested in bringing turbolinks back, further discussion is
welcome.
