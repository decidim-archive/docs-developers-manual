How to test Decidim engines
---------------------------

[[requirements]]
Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You need to create a dummy application to run your tests. Run the
following command in the decidim root's folder:

[source,bash]
----
bundle exec rake test_app
----

[[running-tests-for-a-specific-component]]
Running tests for a specific component
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Decidim engine can be tested running the rake task named after it. For
example, to test the proposals engine, you can run:

[source,bash]
----
bundle exec rake test_proposals
----

[[running-the-whole-test-suite]]
Running the whole test suite
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also run the full thing including test application generation
and tests for all components by running

[source,bash]
----
bundle exec rake test_all
----

But beware, it takes a long time... :)
