Getting started with Decidim
----------------------------

[[what-is-and-what-isnt-decidim]]
What is and what isn't Decidim?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Decidim is a set of Ruby on Rails engines to create a participatory
democracy framework on top of a Ruby on Rails app. This system allows
having Decidim code separated from custom code for each installation and
still enabling easy updates.

These libraries are published to Rubygems.org, so you can add Decidim to
your Ruby on Rails app as external dependencies.

If you want to start your own installation of Decidim, you don't need to
clone this repo. Keep reading to find out how to install Decidim.

Creating your Decidim app
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[a.-recommended-manual-installation]]
A. Recommended: manual installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you know Ruby and have already worked with Ruby on Rails, you need to
know that decidim is a gem and a command line that generates an
application that consumes this gem ðŸ˜….

The flow is: install gem, generate a Ruby on Rails app, enjoy.

[source,console]
----
gem install decidim
decidim decidim_application
----

You can see the link:/docs/manual-installation.md[official manual
installation tutorial], and also you have
https://github.com/Platoniq/decidim-install[another manual installation
tutorial] made by the nice people of http://www.platoniq.net/[Platoniq].

[[b.-using-installation-script-experimental]]
B. Using installation script [experimental]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

_________________________________________
_Please note that this is *experimental*_
_________________________________________

We've made an script for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and macos sierra 10.2. It's a
BETA and as such you should be aware that this could break your
environment (if you have any). It'll install rbenv, postgresql, nodejs
and install decidim on this directory. It should take 15 minutes
depending on your network connection.

[source,console]
----
wget http://get.decidim.org -O install_decidim.bash
bash install_decidim.bash
----

Read more about the
https://github.com/alabs/decidim-install[installation script].

[[c.-using-docker-experimental]]
C. Using Docker [experimental]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can also use https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/[docker] &&
https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/[docker-compose] to develop
decidim. You'll need to install those but in exchange you don't need to
install any other dependency in your computer, not even Ruby!

To get started, first clone the decidim repo

[source,console]
----
git clone https://github.com/decidim/decidim
----

Switch to the cloned folder

[source,console]
----
cd decidim
----

Then create a development application

[source,console]
----
d/bundle install
d/rake development_app
d/rails server
----

In general, to use the docker development environment, change any
instruction in the docs to use its equivalent docker binstub. So for
example, instead of running `bundle install`, you would run
`d/bundle install`.

[[initializing-your-app-for-local-development]]
Initializing your app for local development
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You should now setup your database:

[source,console]
----
bin/rails db:create db:migrate db:seed
----

This will also create some default data so you can start testing the
app:

* A `Decidim::System::Admin` with email `system@example.org` and
password `decidim123456`, to log in at `/system`.
* A `Decidim::Organization` named `Decidim Staging`. You probably want
to change its name and hostname to match your needs.
* A `Decidim::User` acting as an admin for the organization, with email
`admin@example.org` and password `decidim123456`.
* A `Decidim::User` that also belongs to the organization but it's a
regular user, with email `user@example.org` and password
`decidim123456`.

This data won't be created in production environments, if you still want
to do it, run: `$ SEED=true rails db:setup`

You can now start your server!

[source,console]
----
bin/rails s
----

Visit http://localhost:3000 to see your app running.

[[configuration-setup]]
Configuration & setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Decidim comes pre-configured with some safe defaults, but can be changed
through the `config/initializers/decidim.rb` file in your app. Check the
comments there or read the comments in
https://github.com/decidim/decidim/blob/master/decidim-core/lib/decidim/core.rb[the
source file] (the part with the `config_accessor` calls) for more
up-to-date info.

If you want to run the automatic rake task to delete data portability
files, write in `crontab -e`
`0 0 * * * cd /Users/you/projects/myrailsapp && /usr/local/bin/rake RAILS_ENV=production decidim:delete_data_portability_files`

We also have other guides on how to configure some extra components:

* https://github.com/decidim/decidim/blob/master/docs/services/activejob.md[ActiveJob]
* https://github.com/decidim/decidim/blob/master/docs/services/analytics.md[Analytics]:

providers integration]: Enable sign up from social networks.

[[deploy]]
Deploy
~~~~~~

Once you've successfully deployed your app to your favorite platform,
you'll need to create your `System` user. First you'll need to create
your `Decidim::System` user in your production Ruby on Rails console:

[source,ruby]
----
email = <your email>
password = <a secure password>
user = Decidim::System::Admin.new(email: email, password: password, password_confirmation: password)
user.save!
----

This will create a system user with the email and password you set. We
recommend using a random password generator and saving it to a password
manager, so you have a more secure login.

Then, visit the `/system` dashboard and login with the email and
passwords you just entered and create your organization. You're done!
:tada:

You can check the
https://github.com/decidim/decidim/tree/master/decidim-system/README.md[`decidim-system`
README file] for more info on how organizations work.

[[seed-data-in-production]]
Seed data in production
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you want, you can create seed data in production. Run this command in
your production console:

[source,console]
----
SEED=true rails db:seed
----

You'll need to login as system user and edit the host for the
organization. Set it to you production host, without the protocol and
the port (so if your host is `https://my.host:3001`, you need to write
`my.host`).

[[keeping-your-app-up-to-date]]
Keeping your app up-to-date
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We keep releasing new versions of Decidim. In order to get the latest
one, update your dependencies:

[source,console]
----
bundle update decidim
----

And make sure you get all the latest migrations:

[source,console]
----
bin/rails decidim:upgrade
bin/rails db:migrate
----

You can also make sure new translations are complete for all languages
in your application with:

[source,console]
----
bin/rails decidim:check_locales
----

Be aware that this task might not be able to detect everything, so make
sure you also manually check your application before upgrading.

[[checklist]]

~~~~~~~~~

There are several things you need to check before making your putting
