CSS Styles with SASS
--------------------

One of the first things youâ€™ll want to do after you install Decidim is
applying your own corporative image. To do this, you can go to
app/assets/stylesheets/application.css.sass on your generated
application with your own colors. There you can override any class using
CSS with SASS.

In
https://github.com/decidim/decidim/blob/master/decidim-core/app/assets/stylesheets/decidim/_variables.scss[decidim-core/app/assets/stylesheets/decidim/_variables.scss]
you can find the `variables` that can be overriden in your `sass`.

We use http://sass-lang.com/guide[SASS, with SCSS syntax] as CSS
preprocessor.
