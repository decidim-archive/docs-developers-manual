Custom Texts
------------

You can change most of the texts through the Administration panel.

If you want to change a given text that isn’t on the Administration
panel, and belongs on Decidim code, you should first find out which key
is being used. For instance, you want to change the home page text where
it says "Let's build a more open, transparent and collaborative
society.", you would search the text (using
https://github.com/decidim/decidim/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=%22Let%27s+build+a+more+open%2C+transparent+and+collaborative+society.%22&type=[github]
or grep) and then you would extract that key and their parents. On this
case it’d be:

[source,yml]
----
en:
  pages:
    home:
      footer_sub_hero:
        footer_sub_hero_body: Let's build a more open, transparent and collaborative society.<br /> Join, participate and decide.
----

You need to create a file for this translation as
http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html[Ruby on Rails i18n
documentation] says, for instance config/locales/home.en.yml
