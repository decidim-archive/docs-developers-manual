Configuring geocoding
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Decidim has the ability to geocode proposals and meetings using Open
Street Maps, for instance, you can use http://here.com[Here] service. We
can't use the OSM server by their
https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/tiles/[tile usage policy].
As an alternative, you may also want to use your own
https://opentileserver.org/[self-hosted tile server].

After generating your app, you'll see that your
`config/initializers/decidim.rb` file has come commented code about
geocoding:

[source,ruby]
----
# Geocoder configuration
# config.geocoder = {
#   static_map_url: "https://image.maps.cit.api.here.com/mia/1.6/mapview",
#   here_app_id: Rails.application.secrets.geocoder[:here_app_id],
#   here_app_code: Rails.application.secrets.geocoder[:here_app_code]
# }
----

If you want to enable geocoding in your app:

1.  Uncomment or add the previous code in your
`config/initializers/decidim.rb`.
2.  Make sure your `config/secrets.yml` file has the needed section (it
should be added by the generator automatically).
3.  Get your app ID and code from Here.com and set them as environment
variables, as required by your `config/secrets.yml` file.
4.  If you had your Rails server running, restart it so the changes
apply.

Enabling geocoding
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once geocoding is configured, you'll need to activate it. As of April
2017, only proposals and meetings have geocoding.

[[proposals]]
Proposals
^^^^^^^^^

In order to enable geocoding for proposals you'll need to edit the
feature configuration and set the global flag to true. This works for
that specific component, so you can have geocoding enabled for meetings
in a participatory process, and disabled for another one.

[[meetings]]
Meetings
^^^^^^^^

Meetings do not have a configuration option for geocoding. Instead, if
geocoding is configured it will try to geocode the address every time
you create or update a meeting.. As of April 2017 there's no way to
enable or disable geocoding per meetings component.
