Decidim::Initiatives
--------------------

Initiatives is the place on Decidim's where citizens can promote a civic
initiative. Unlike participatory processes that must be created by an
administrator, Civic initiatives can be created by any user of the
platform.

An initiative will contain attachments and comments from other users as
well.

Prior to be published an initiative must be technically validated. All
the validation process and communication between the platform
administrators and the sponsorship committee is managed via an
administration UI.

[[usage]]

[[rake-tasks]]
Rake tasks
~~~~~~~~~~

This engine comes with three rake tasks that should be executed on daily
basis. The best way to execute these tasks is using cron jobs. You can
manage this cron jobs in your Rails application using the
https://github.com/javan/whenever[Whenever GEM] or even creating them by
hand.

[[decidim_initiativescheck_validating]]
decidim_initiatives:check_validating
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This task move all initiatives in validation phase without changes for
the amount of time defined in
*Decidim::Initiatives::max_time_in_validating_state*. These initiatives
will be moved to *discarded* state.

[[decidim_initiativescheck_published]]
decidim_initiatives:check_published
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This task retrieves all published initiatives whose support method is
online and the support period has expired. Initiatives that have reached
the minimum supports required will pass to state *accepted*. The
initiatives without enough supports will pass to *rejected* state.

Initiatives with offline support method enabled (pure offline or mixed)
will get its status updated after the presential supports have been
registered into the system.

[[decidim_initiativesnotify_progress]]
decidim_initiatives:notify_progress
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This task sends notification mails when initiatives reaches the support
percentages defined in
*Decidim::Initiatives.first_notification_percentage* and
*Decidim::Initiatives.second_notification_percentage*.

Author, members of the promoter committee and followers will receive it.

[[exporting-online-signatures]]
Exporting online signatures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the signature method is set to any or face to face it may be
necessary to implement a mechanism to validate that there are no
duplicated signatures. To do so the engine provides a functionality that
allows exporting the online signatures to validate them against physical
signatures.

The signatures are exported as a hash string in order to preserve the
identity of the signer together with her privacy. Each hash is composed
with the following criteria:

* Algorithm used: SHA1
* Format of the string hashed: "#\{unique_id}#\{title}#\{description}"

There are some considerations that you must keep in mind:

* Title and description will be hashed using the same format included in
the database, this is including html tags.
* Title and description will be hashed using the same locale used by the
initiative author. In case there is more than one locale available be
sure that you change your locale settings to be inline with the locale
used to generate the hashes outside Decidim.

[[seeding-example-data]]
Seeding example data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to populate the database with example data proceed as usual in
rails:

[source,bash]
----
bundle exec rails db:seed
----

[[cookies]]
Cookies
^^^^^^^

This engine makes use of cookies to store large form data. You should
change the default session store or you might experience problems.
