[[static-pages]]
Static pages
^^^^^^^^^^^^

This component allows an admin to create pages to serve static content.
Some example of this kind of pages could be:

* Terms and Conditions
* FAQ
* Accessibility guidelines
* About the project

All the pages can be created with I18n support and will be accessible as
`/pages/:page-slug`. You can link them at your website the same way you
link other Rails models: `pages_path("terms-and-conditions")`.

There are some pages that exist by default and cannot be deleted since
there are links to them inside the Decidim framework, see
`Decidim::StaticPage` for the default list.
