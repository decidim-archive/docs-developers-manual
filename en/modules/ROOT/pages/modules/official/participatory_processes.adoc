Decidim::ParticipatoryProcesses
-------------------------------

Participatory processes are the standard Decidim's participatory space.

A participatory process can define its own steps, and attach different
components (such as meetings or proposals) with different configurations
to each of them.

A participatory process can have attachments, be associated to custom
categories, and are fully manageable via an administration UI.
