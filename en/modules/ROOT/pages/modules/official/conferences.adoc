Decidim::Conferences
--------------------

Conferences are the permanent Decidim's participatory space. They are
always "active" so unlike participatory processes, they have no steps or
phases.

A conference can get different components (such as blogs or proposals)
attached. It can also have attachments, be associated to custom
categories or scopes, and can be fully managed via an administration UI.
