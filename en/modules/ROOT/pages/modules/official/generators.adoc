[[generating-decidim-applications]]
Generating decidim applications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use the command

[source,console]
----
decidim my_new_application
----

to generate a fresh new decidim application.

[[generating-decidim-components]]
Generating decidim components
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This repo helps you generating the scheleton of a decidim component. It
will generate a folder with a plugin's code skeleton that you then need
to properly require in your final decidim application in order to use
it. To do that, you need to include the plugin in your application's
`Gemfile`.

For example, if you generated your component at
`~/decidim-module-experimental_component`, you'll need to edit your
`Gemfile` like this in order for the component to be used:

[source,ruby]
----
gem "decidim-experimental_plugin", path: "~/decidim-module-experimental_plugin"
----

Once you do that, and boot your application, you'll see the new
component being offered in the "New component" selector on the
"Components" section of any participatory space in the admin dashboard.

[[generate-a-new-component]]
Generate a new component
++++++++++++++++++++++++

[source,console]
----
decidim --component my_component
----

[[generate-a-new-component-in-a-specific-folder]]
Generate a new component in a specific folder
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

You may do this when you want to point to an existing folder or give it
a custom name.

[source,console]
----
decidim --component my_component --destination_folder ../decidim-module-my_component
----

[[generate-a-new-component-as-a-external-plugin]]
Generate a new component as a external plugin
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

You may do this when your plugin is meant to live outside of decidim's
core repo. The generated application has some particularities as opposed
to a plugin living in the core repo. For example:

* It has its own Gemfile.
* The dummy application path is different.

[source,console]
----
decidim --component my_component --external
